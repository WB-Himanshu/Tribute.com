        words of indo-tibetian rebellion mirs tano ,tano was born in the south
        of arunchal pradesh in the family of goat farmers ,fighting with poverty
        and illiteracy he joined a monastary at the age four just so that he can
        get food , soon he was taught mix martial arts and meditation by a
        tibetian guru SIKO GORA ,when china took over tibet , they try to take
        this monastry also ,but Gora along with other Thirty nine monks fought
        back to save it , thirty monks died in that annexation until indian army
        came and balanced the situation , Tano got injured but some hown he
        saved himself, till that time he was 12 , due to brave fighting skills
        he got famous in the village and then later in the city .
      </p>
      <p>
        Some says he worked as local spy for indian army , but tano always
        publically denies that , he along with the rest of the monks gauraded
        and provided shelter to the tibetian refugees , he taught them self
        defence and budhist literature ,when he was 29 he became the cheif monk
        of the monastary and later he become state head of the buddist
        union,just to attract buddhist communities many political parties gave
        him tickets in the election , but he refuses them ,after few years a
        flood came , which killed almost a million peoples , tano with his
        students helped many to save , even he started giving monasteries on
        rent just to earn money and donate to the needy .when this all thing was
        going on,chinese soilders came inside the indian border and again try to
        conquer the state, poeple were unpowered they dont have even basic daily
        things such as food shelter , how would they fight with the soilders
        having adavanced weaponaries , and chicken neck was seized by the naxals
        fighting against the indian army ,chinese were killing thousands of
        poeples daily, after seeing all this brutal killings and rapes ,tano
        illegally bought weapons from the mynammar and made his small army , a
        army of 500 hundred peoples against the army of 2000 chinese soilder ,
        Tano and his mates fought strategically using gorilla warfare in three
        days and they took control over the state on the other hand indian army
        killed the naxals and reached there and took the complete control of the
        borders,Tano students have captured one chinese soilder alive all him to
        be punished by the law , but for maintaining good dipliomatic relation
        state goverment send him back ,this changed the history over there
        ,millions of people came on the street supporting Tano as the one and
        only leader of the state , president rule was applied but that changed
      </p>
      <p>
        After eight month of protest and the death of 988 peoples in that
        protest , Goverment of india charged tano for influencing peoples to
        break the integrity of india , he was put to jail and thrased brutally
        by the police ,while his supporters burned down the whole state to the
        ashes , after a year of chaos finally election were declared and tano
        won by record two million votes .At the age of 57 he was shot by a
        sniper while attending a dipliomatic summit in the frosia region of
        china,after his death his student UBO HIBA become cheif minister and
        ordered an attack on china , a war like situation came in which the
        state police was fighting with chines forces , indian army came in the
        middle to stop this ,after 9 talks and death of 5690 peoples the war
